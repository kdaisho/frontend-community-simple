<h2>Mission</h2>

<p class="msg">
  The Brailler Community is a dedicated space for Braille users and their partners, built to foster
  connection, support, and learning. Our mission is to bridge the gap between Braille literacy and
  everyday life, empowering users and their families, friends, and allies with resources, tools, and
  shared experiences. Whether you're a seasoned Braille reader, just starting out, or a loved one
  seeking to understand more, we're here for you.
